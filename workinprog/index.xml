      <title>Socializing Alone: How Online Homophily Has Undermined Social Cohesion in the US</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online social networks have changed how people interact across large distances. We examine the long-run effect of a key feature of these networks - online homophily - on interpersonal interactions in local communities. Using Facebook data, we measure online homophily across counties in the United States. To identify effects, we exploit a conflict between Facebook and Google in the early expansion phase of Facebook, which induced persistent variation in online homophily across counties. Using various measures of both online and offline behavior, we find evidence that local social interactions have been affected. In particular, homophilic connections made people use Facebook more often but socialize less offline, as measured through bar, restaurant, and live sports events visits. Individuals have also become less connected across income strata. Political opinions within counties became more diverse, with a lowered probability that two voters in a county support the same political party. Overall, our results indicate that when a natural demand for connecting with socially similar people is met by the supply of a &amp;lsquo;death-of-distance&amp;rsquo; technology, it comes at the cost of short-distance social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nation Building in Post-Conflict Settings: Evidence from South Africa</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do states rebuild nations after a major conflict? Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) have emerged as one of the most common interventions to achieve this objective. Despite their popularity, little is known about their efficacy to foster reconciliation and nation-building. We fill this gap by studying the seminal TRC established in South Africa after the end of Apartheid. To measure exposure to TRC across South African municipalities, we leverage quasi random variation in media coverage of the TRC message. South African municipalities with higher historical exposure to TRC on media have lower levels of violence today. This effect is driven by improved nation-building and higher trust towards post-Apartheid institutions. Exploiting daily variation in TRC hearings and mediatic exposure in the short-run, we bolster our interpretation that our long-run results are forged in the years of the TRC activity. The same evidence suggests that our results are driven by the coverage of TRC on media as opposed to generic media exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Outmigration and Economic Development: Evidence from the Italian Mass Migration</title>
      <link>https://gianlucarusso.github.io/workinprog/outmigration/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does emigration affect economic development? We study this question in the context of the Italian mass emigration between 1884 and 1913, when twelve million Italians left the country.
We assemble a unique dataset at the municipality level, linking cumulative emigration rates to a number of indicators of economic development throughout the twentieth century.
Exploiting variation in the availability of information about the potential gains from migration before the start of mass migration, we construct an instrumental variable for the total emigration rate.
Results indicate that while instrumented cumulative emigration was balanced on population before the start of mass emigration, it had a negative, large, and highly persistent effect on short and long run population. Historical mass emigration also reduced educational attainment, income per capita and other proxies of economic development in the long run. Further, we show that emigration favored the expansion of the agricultural sector, at the expense of manufacturing. We speculate that selective emigration was a key mechanism behind our results.&lt;/p&gt;
