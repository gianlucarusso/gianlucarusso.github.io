      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key steps that allowed Mussolini to become the Italian Duce was the victory in the 1924 national elections. I study the impact of World War I on Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s electoral success. To gauge the effect of the war, I construct a measure of military casualties from the universe of Italian municipalities, which is matched to municipal level voting in the 1924 election. Controlling for the number of military drafted in an Italian municipality, variation in the share of casualties is induced by military events exogenous to municipality characteristics that could simultaneously affect support for Fascism. Using this conditional independence approach, I find that a higher share of casualties increases the vote share for Fascism. More than half of the increase in the vote share for Mussolini is matched by a decrease in the vote share of the Socialist party. I decompose the effect of the casualties rate by its intensity to show that the number of casualties interacted positively with the number of veterans back from the frontline. I interpret this as evidence that Fascist support was driven by municipalities where the high number of casualties was matched by veterans militarized and brutalized by the war experience.&lt;/p&gt;
