      <title>Regulating Child Labor: Evidence from the US Progressive Era</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1880 to 1920, child labor in the United States fell dramatically. At the same time, most states passed laws regulating minimum working ages and mandating compulsory schooling laws. Past quantitative work based on census samples have yielded mixed results on the efficacy of these laws and historians have questioned whether the politically powerful employers of children would allow such regulation if child labor was in high demand. Turning to the newly-digitized complete count census data from 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930, we find large effects of child labor laws and compulsory schooling laws on child labor. While Progressive era legislation reduced labor supply from boys and girls in equal measure, the laws did had differential effects, binding in urban areas especially in the largest cities and more for the children of foreign-born parents. Children with parents working in manufacturing and textiles were especially affected by the labor restrictions.
In contrast to the reduction of labor supply among white children in urban areas, we find that legislation had mixed effects on the odds of children not explicitly targeted by the reformers, in particular rural white and black children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age of Radio in the United States signed a revolution of media access in the country.
&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;wells.png&#34;&gt;
To study the effect of radio on American society during the interwar period I coded in R a model of ground wave propagation that, given the characteristics of the transmitting antenna and the distance of the receiver outputs the signal strength of the ground wave.
The model takes into accounts ground conductivity that is the most important factor that affects the attenuation of the ground wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical details of AM radio propagation and the way I implemented the model are available

      <title>Mass Media and Cultural Assimilation: Broadcasting the American Dream on Radio</title>
      <link>https://gianlucarusso.github.io/workingpapers/radio/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does media shape culture? I leverage the expansion of radio networks in the United States to identify the impact of access to mass media on cultural assimilation and homogenization. I reconstruct radio network access via a signal propagation model suitable to AM radio, the only radio technology available at the time. I determine what radio channels were available to American households by feeding the propagation model with newly digitized data on the universe of transmitting stations during the interwar period. I combine radio network coverage with several measures of cultural change based on naming patterns for children. Exploiting exogenous variation in radio signal reception induced by soil characteristics and stations&amp;rsquo; tower growth over time, I provide evidence that network access homogenized American culture. Homogenization occurred through the assimilation of white immigrant and black households towards mainstream white native culture. Assimilation is strongest for immigrant families: foreign parents were six percent more likely to name their sons using popular white names after network access. Focusing on names from baseball players, I suggest that aspirational naming is a key mechanism to explain certain features of the results. While foreign households picked from the full distribution of baseball names, native families chose names exclusively from the most successful, those featured in the All-Star games. Thus, in addition to diffusing information, the radio has subtler effects, increasing the likelihood of &amp;ldquo;naming for success&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
