In this paper, we argue that there was a strong link between the surge of support for the Socialist Party after World War I (WWI) and the subsequent emergence of Fascism in Italy. We first develop a source of variation in socialist support across Italian municipalities in the 1919 election based on war casualties from the area. We show that these casualties are unrelated to a battery of political, economic and social variables before the war and had a major impact on socialist support (partly because the Socialists were the main anti-war political movement). Our main result is that this boost to socialist support (that is “exogenous” to the prior political leaning of the municipality) led to greater local fascist activity as measured by local party branches and fascist political violence (squadrismo), and to significantly larger vote share of the Fascist Party in the 1921 and 1924 elections. We also provide evidence that landowner associations and greater presence of local elites played an important role in the rise of Fascism. Finally, we find greater likelihood of Jewish deportations in 1943-45 and lower vote share for Christian Democrats after World War II in areas with greater early fascist activity.

This development coincided with the conclusion of the Age of Mass Migration, a historical period characterized by record-high diversity within the US society. How did the sudden rise of national radio networks affect the assimilation of millions of immigrants in the US? I answer this question by building quasi-random variation in the initial expansion of radio networks coverage. Through the application of a difference-in-difference design and leveraging evidence from diverse samples, I document that higher exposure to radio networks facilitated immigrant assimilation across various outcomes, including higher rates of intermarriage with natives, increased naturalization, and a greater propensity to adopt names that sounded less foreign. Additionally, I find that exposure to radio networks led to enhanced English proficiency among recently arrived immigrants. I argue that a key channel of assimilation was through the impact of role models on the media. Using data on baseball, I show that immigrants perceived baseball players as media role models of assimilation. Immigrant households were more likely to name their children after baseball players who shared similar ancestral origins to them or who achieved notable success during a season.","date":1615766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615766400,"objectID":"e2ef996368e48a8f713eb9f5334d7fc5","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/publications/radio/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/radio/","section":"publications","summary":" [Link to Working Paper](https://gianlucarusso.github.io/radio_draft_apr24.pdf)  [SSRN Working Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4813824)  [Radio Appendix](https://gianlucarusso.github.io/radioappendix_april24.pdf)","tags":null,"title":"Media and Assimilation: Evidence from the Golden Age of Radio (2024)","type":"publications"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Online social networks have changed how people interact across large distances. We examine the long-run effect of a key feature of these networks - online homophily - on interpersonal interactions in local communities. Using Facebook data, we measure online homophily across counties in the United States. To identify effects, we exploit a conflict between Facebook and Google in the early expansion phase of Facebook, which induced persistent variation in online homophily across counties. Using various online and offline behavior measures, we find evidence that local social interactions have been affected. In particular, homophilic connections made people use Facebook more often but socialize less offline, as measured through bar, restaurant, and live sports events visits. Individuals have also become less connected across the income strata. Political opinions within counties became more diverse, with a lower probability that two county voters support the same political party. Overall, our results indicate that when a natural demand for connecting with socially similar people is met by the supply of a ‘death-of-distance’ technology, it comes at the cost of short-distance social cohesion.","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"0e9b7dc04ce48b437797975934cc1f3e","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/publications/facebook/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/facebook/","section":"publications","summary":"Joint with Ruben Enikolopov, Maria Petrova and David Yanagizawa-Drott  [Link to Working Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4738801) ","tags":null,"title":"Socializing Alone: How Online Homophily Has Undermined Social Cohesion in the US (2024)","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract How do states rebuild nations after a major conflict? Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) have emerged as one of the most common interventions to achieve this objective. Despite their popularity, little is known about their efficacy to foster reconciliation and nation-building. We fill this gap by studying the seminal TRC established in South Africa after the end of Apartheid. To measure exposure to TRC across South African municipalities, we leverage quasi random variation in media coverage of the TRC message. South African municipalities with higher historical exposure to TRC on media have lower levels of violence today. This effect is driven by improved nation-building and higher trust towards post-Apartheid institutions. Exploiting daily variation in TRC hearings and mediatic exposure in the short-run, we bolster our interpretation that our long-run results are forged in the years of the TRC activity. The same evidence suggests that our results are driven by the coverage of TRC on media as opposed to generic media exposure.","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d67d6dd1fb6b79d6e0107d8ef8e31c9f","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/workinprog/trc/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workinprog/trc/","section":"workinprog","summary":"Joint with Thomas Gautier and Daniela Horta-Saenz Funded by UNU WIDER and CEPR-STEG SRG.

We study this question in the context of the Italian mass emigration between 1884 and 1913, when twelve million Italians left the country. We assemble a unique dataset at the municipality level, linking cumulative emigration rates to a number of indicators of economic development throughout the twentieth century. Exploiting variation in the availability of information about the potential gains from migration before the start of mass migration, we construct an instrumental variable for the total emigration rate. Results indicate that while instrumented cumulative emigration was balanced on population before the start of mass emigration, it had a negative, large, and highly persistent effect on short and long run population. Historical mass emigration also reduced educational attainment, income per capita and other proxies of economic development in the long run. Further, we show that emigration favored the expansion of the agricultural sector, at the expense of manufacturing. We speculate that selective emigration was a key mechanism behind our results.","date":1609286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609286400,"objectID":"01576dbb073f1b0e26580530796808fe","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/workinprog/outmigration/","publishdate":"2020-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workinprog/outmigration/","section":"workinprog","summary":"Joint with Nicola Fontana, Marco Manacorda and Marco Tabellini","tags":null,"title":"Outmigration and Economic Development: Evidence from the Italian Mass Migration","type":"workinprog"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract From 1880 to 1920, child labor in the United States fell dramatically. At the same time, most states passed laws regulating minimum working ages and mandating compulsory schooling laws. Past quantitative work based on census samples have yielded mixed results on the efficacy of these laws and historians have questioned whether the politically powerful employers of children would allow such regulation if child labor was in high demand. Turning to the newly-digitized complete count census data from 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930, we find large effects of child labor laws and compulsory schooling laws on child labor. While Progressive era legislation reduced labor supply from boys and girls in equal measure, the laws did had differential effects, binding in urban areas especially in the largest cities and more for the children of foreign-born parents. Children with parents working in manufacturing and textiles were especially affected by the labor restrictions. In contrast to the reduction of labor supply among white children in urban areas, we find that legislation had mixed effects on the odds of children not explicitly targeted by the reformers, in particular rural white and black children.

The goal of the propaganda was to manufacture a narrative that would legitimate and place the birth of Fascism among the battlefields of the war. To do so, the Ministry allocated substantial resources to the task. It hired the most prominent statisticians and utilized Powers and Hollerit accounting machines to process data for the first time in Italian history. Although with some discrepancies, Giorgio Mortara and Corrado Gini worked up to conclude that approximately 650,000 Italian soldiers died during or immediately after the conflict.1\nThe sources used to piece the records together were multiple. These encompassed data from the various statistical offices of the army and the Ministry of War, records from Italian municipalities and data from the Italian and Austrian Red Cross. The Ministry started the publication of the first roll of honor in 1926. Comprising 28 volumes, the publication was concluded only in 1964. Each volume lists the fatalities by Italian macro regions. Among the information included are the municipality and data of birth, rank and unit at time of death, cause and place of death. The historical municipality of birth refers to the name of the municipality as it appeared on the drafting cards, hence approximately the end of the nineteenth century.\nOne can search individual records on different websites.
