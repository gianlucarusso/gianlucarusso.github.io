In this paper, we argue that there was a strong link between the surge of support for the Socialist Party after World War I (WWI) and the subsequent emergence of Fascism in Italy. We first develop a source of variation in socialist support across Italian municipalities in the 1919 election based on war casualties from the area. We show that these casualties are unrelated to a battery of political, economic and social variables before the war and had a major impact on socialist support (partly because the Socialists were the main anti-war political movement). Our main result is that this boost to socialist support (that is “exogenous” to the prior political leaning of the municipality) led to greater local fascist activity as measured by local party branches and fascist political violence (squadrismo), and to significantly larger vote share of the Fascist Party in the 1921 and 1924 elections. We also provide evidence that landowner associations and greater presence of local elites played an important role in the rise of Fascism. Finally, we find greater likelihood of Jewish deportations in 1943-45 and lower vote share for Christian Democrats after World War II in areas with greater early fascist activity.\n","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"2f3b066bf36287a2006657fc63a9236c","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/project/wwi/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/wwi/","section":"project","summary":" _The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 137, Issue 2, May 2022, Pages 1233-1296_  [Link to Published Version](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/137/2/1233/6513426)  [Link to NBER Working Paper](https://gianlucarusso.github.io/w27854.pdf)","tags":null,"title":"War, Socialism and the Rise of Fascism: An Empirical Exploration (2022)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract In this paper, I argue that exposure to mainstream mass media facilitates immigrants\u0026rsquo; assimilation. I exploit the rise and expansion of radio broadcasting in the United States after the Age of Mass Migration ended to identify the effect of radio exposure on immigrants\u0026rsquo; assimilation. I reconstruct exogenous exposure to radio networks using a novel propagation model suitable to AM radio, the only radio technology available at the time. Exploiting the US full count census, I find that radio networks had a strong effect on immigrants\u0026rsquo; assimilation. Immigrants exposed to radio networks exerted higher effort to assimilate by naming their children with less distinctively foreign names and by becoming US citizens more often. Exposure to US radio networks also increased the likelihood of marrying a US citizen from US-born parents. Using names from baseball players, I show that aspiration might have been a key mechanism to explain why radio promoted assimilation. Immigrant households named their children exclusively after players that performed particularly well during the season, suggesting they were \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;naming for success.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;\n","date":1615766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615766400,"objectID":"e2ef996368e48a8f713eb9f5334d7fc5","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/publications/radio/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/radio/","section":"publications","summary":"New Draft Coming Soon","tags":null,"title":"Media and Assimilation: Evidence from the Golden Age of Radio (2021)","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Joint with [Ruben Enikolopov](https://sites.google.com/site/rubenenikolopov/), [Maria Petrova](https://sites.google.com/site/mariapetrovaphd/) and [David Yanagizawa-Drott](https://yanagizawadrott.com) "],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"a76f737f8162286b4054ddc2b5d70adc","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/workinprog/facebook/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workinprog/facebook/","section":"workinprog","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Echo Chambers: Does Online Network Structure Affect Political Polarization?","type":"workinprog"},{"authors":["Joint with [Thomas Gautier](https://sites.google.com/view/thomasgautier) and [Daniela Horta-Saenz](https://sites.google.com/view/danielahortasenz/home)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d67d6dd1fb6b79d6e0107d8ef8e31c9f","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/workinprog/trc/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workinprog/trc/","section":"workinprog","summary":"Funded by [UNU WIDER](https://www.wider.unu.edu/opportunity/institutional-legacies-violent-conflict) and [STEG SGR](https://steg.cepr.org)","tags":null,"title":"Nation Building in Post-Conflict Settings: Evidence from South Africa","type":"workinprog"},{"authors":["Joint with [Nicola Fontana](https://sites.google.com/view/nicola-fontana/home?authuser=0), [Marco Manacorda](https://sites.google.com/site/marcomanacorda/home) and [Marco Tabellini](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1060330) "],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609286400,"objectID":"01576dbb073f1b0e26580530796808fe","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/workinprog/outmigration/","publishdate":"2020-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workinprog/outmigration/","section":"workinprog","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Outmigration and Economic Development: Evidence from the Italian Mass Migration","type":"workinprog"},{"authors":["Joint with [James Feigenbaum](https://jamesfeigenbaum.github.io)"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract From 1880 to 1920, child labor in the United States fell dramatically. At the same time, most states passed laws regulating minimum working ages and mandating compulsory schooling laws. Past quantitative work based on census samples have yielded mixed results on the efficacy of these laws and historians have questioned whether the politically powerful employers of children would allow such regulation if child labor was in high demand. Turning to the newly-digitized complete count census data from 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930, we find large effects of child labor laws and compulsory schooling laws on child labor. While Progressive era legislation reduced labor supply from boys and girls in equal measure, the laws did had differential effects, binding in urban areas especially in the largest cities and more for the children of foreign-born parents. Children with parents working in manufacturing and textiles were especially affected by the labor restrictions. In contrast to the reduction of labor supply among white children in urban areas, we find that legislation had mixed effects on the odds of children not explicitly targeted by the reformers, in particular rural white and black children.\n","date":1592179200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592179200,"objectID":"ecb41adabc6ba9c334bc86bd1ab07af0","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/publications/cll/","publishdate":"2020-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/cll/","section":"publications","summary":" [Link to Working Paper](https://gianlucarusso.github.io/cll_draft_may20.pdf) ","tags":null,"title":"Regulating Child Labor: Evidence from the US Progressive Era (2020)","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As part of the state propaganda, the Fascist regime organized a massive data collection on the identity of all the military personnel who died during WWI. The goal of the propaganda was to manufacture a narrative that would legitimate and place the birth of Fascism among the battlefields of the war. To do so, the Ministry allocated substantial resources to the task. It hired the most prominent statisticians and utilized Powers and Hollerit accounting machines to process data for the first time in Italian history. Although with some discrepancies, Giorgio Mortara and Corrado Gini worked up to conclude that approximately 650,000 Italian soldiers died during or immediately after the conflict.1\nThe sources used to piece the records together were multiple. These encompassed data from the various statistical offices of the army and the Ministry of War, records from Italian municipalities and data from the Italian and Austrian Red Cross. The Ministry started the publication of the first roll of honor in 1926. Comprising 28 volumes, the publication was concluded only in 1964. Each volume lists the fatalities by Italian macro regions. Among the information included are the municipality and data of birth, rank and unit at time of death, cause and place of death. The historical municipality of birth refers to the name of the municipality as it appeared on the drafting cards, hence approximately the end of the nineteenth century.\nOne can search individual records on different websites. However, the most comprehensive one is probably cadutigrandeguerra.it. It is curated by Istoreco: the Institute for the history of the Resistance.\n  Historical Demographer Alessio Fornasin has written a lot about the different estimates of WWI Italian fatalities. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1587772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587772800,"objectID":"4a10d417c0cade528c0cf7eedcf00e15","permalink":"https://gianlucarusso.github.io/data_projects/wwi_cas/","publishdate":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/data_projects/wwi_cas/","section":"data_projects","summary":"It took 38 years to assemble the list of Italian fatalities.
